# Notes Test

This project was started on 04.03.23 as a test assignment for Severstal IT Hub internship.

### Why Javascript and React?

Despite being a bit more familiar with Java and Kotlin, I decided to use React for this task because of the following reasons:
1. It seemed like an optimal variant in terms of time and effort.
2. It was a good opportunity to learn something new and hone problem-solving skills in an unfamiliar environment and under time pressure.
3. Guides, tutorials and other documentation for React were somewhat more comprehensive and easier to find.
4. I have a proclivity for design and UI - frontend work seems to be the best application of these skills.

### Resources

While Material UI library is highly attractive both in terms of usability and design,
my conscious choice was to refrain from using it. What I ended up using are the React Transition Group
for smooth movement animations, React Icons, and various ready-made coding techniques in open access.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## React Bootstrap Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

To learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).
